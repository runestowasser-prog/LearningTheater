# üé≠ Learning Theater

**Learning Theater** is a property-based JavaScript engine and authoring environment for building interactive learning scenes.  
It combines a live **GUI editor**, a **trigger-based event system**, **timeline animation via GSAP**, and optional **SCORM 1.2 integration**, giving authors full control over both logic and presentation.

---

## ‚ú® Overview

Learning Theater is designed for creators who want the flexibility of custom scripting ‚Äî without sacrificing usability.  
Scenes are built using **Actors**, which are JavaScript objects automatically mirrored to the DOM.  
A visual editor lets you modify properties, manage triggers, and preview interactions in real-time.

The system is modular: you can extend it with new **Conditions**, **Actions**, and **Property types** as needed.  
Learning Theater aims to provide a middle ground between commercial authoring tools like *Articulate Storyline* or *Adobe Captivate* and fully custom-coded e-learning experiences.

## üß© Core Concepts

### **Actors**
Actors are scene elements with properties that automatically sync with the DOM.  
For example, changing `Actor.X` immediately updates its position on screen.

Each Actor supports:
- Live property editing
- Boolean toggles (`Draggable`, `ShowOrigin`, etc.)
- Parent/child relationships
- Dynamic updates through scripting or GUI

---

### **Triggers**
A flexible event system where each trigger is defined by:
- **Event** (what happens)
- **Conditions** (when it happens)
- **Actions** (what to do)

Conditions and actions are defined as modular objects with argument definitions and a `build()` function that generates executable code.

```js
Conditions["SCORM Status is"] = {
  label: "SCORM status is",
  category: "SCORM",
  args: [
    { type: "dropdown", label: "Status", options: ["passed", "completed", "failed"] }
  ],
  build: (args) => `GetStatus() === "${args[0]}"`
};
```

###Editor

The visual editor provides:

Live property editing and staged updates (applyStagedEdit)

Dropdowns, toggles, and number inputs for each property type

Trigger creation with categorized condition/action lists

An optional code editor for global scripts like General, Build, SceneStart, etc.

###Timeline Animation (GSAP)

Learning Theater includes a timeline-based animation editor powered by GSAP.
You can animate any Actor property visually, chain keyframes, and play or preview animations directly in the scene editor.

###SCORM 1.2 Integration

Optional SCORM integration (via pipwerks.SCORM) provides:

Reading and writing of LMS data

Manual control of variables and objectives

Safe getters and setters to prevent runtime errors

Custom handling of cmi.comments and lesson_status

Unlike traditional tools, Learning Theater gives you full control over what data is saved and when.


###üöÄ Example Workflow

Create Actors in the editor or via code inside Build()

Define Triggers to handle interactivity

Add animations via the GSAP timeline editor

Connect to an LMS via SCORM (optional)

Export your project as a standalone SCORM package or HTML module

###üí° Design Philosophy

‚ÄúFull control, minimal friction.‚Äù

Learning Theater doesn‚Äôt hide the logic behind wizards ‚Äî it exposes it.
Everything the editor generates can be read, modified, and exported as clean, human-readable JavaScript.

You decide:

When and how to save SCORM data

How properties are updated

What logic defines your interactivity
